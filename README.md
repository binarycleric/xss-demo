# XSS Demo

This is a simple Rack application that's meant to demonstrate a few XSS attack examples. More examples will be added whenever I feel like it. Have an example you'd like to share? Feel free to submit a Pull Request.

## Getting Started

```bash
$ cd ~/src/xss-demo
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rackup
```

Now open your browser and go to `http://0:9292`.
